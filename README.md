# Stock-recommandation-via-machine-learning-algorithms
Utilized some supervised machine learning models to choose stocks, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.  
With these models, I can predict the stock’s 60 days’ return rate. If a specific stock outperformed the average return rate, the model would recommend holding the position. The data is from stocks of the listed companies in China from Tushare’ API, which is a financial data platform.
